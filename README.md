A very basic Arena API example using Angular.js

**Installation:**

Copy this html file to anywhere on a webserver, and have at it!

**Note:**

If you are developing locally, I use python's SimpleHTTPServer. Navigate to your folder in the terminal and paste:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
    
Then, visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
